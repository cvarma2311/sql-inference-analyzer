# Step 11 - Test With Fixed NL Queries

## Goal
Validate the end-to-end pipeline with a deterministic test suite.

## Inputs
- A set of 10 fixed NL queries with expected behaviors.

## Actions
- Run the planner, builder, executor, inference, and narrative stages.
- Compare outputs against expected results or invariants.

## Exit Criteria
- All 10 queries complete without validator errors.
- Outputs meet expected constraints and consistency checks.
